A fully qualified type name is a string that uniquely identifies a type within an assembly and includes the namespace, type name, and assembly information. It consists of the complete namespace, the class name, and optionally, the assembly name, separated by a comma. Fully qualified type names are useful when loading and working with types through Reflection, or when ensuring that the correct type is used in instances where there may be multiple types with the same name in different namespaces or assemblies.

The fully qualified type name has the following format: Namespace.TypeName, AssemblyName. For example, for a class called Customer in the MyApp.Models namespace, contained in the MyApp assembly, the fully qualified type name would be: MyApp.Models.Customer, MyApp.

To see the fully qualified type name, you can use the Type class in .NET along with the AssemblyQualifiedName property.
